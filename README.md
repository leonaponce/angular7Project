Deliverables

The purpose of the app is to give a complete beginner to AI/ML a "Resource Roadmap," much like a little syllabus of resources to better understand the concepts and sub-fields of this powerful tech. All recommendations/resources will sourced from working AI/ML software engineers.

1. User will be able to see a resource's description, difficulty level, estimated time of completion, and concepts covered. 
2. User will will be able to edit their syllabus to their liking in order and content, should they wish to skip a resource.
3. 2 main features available to user: "Resource Roadmap Feature" and "Intro to AI/ML Resource Guide Feature."
